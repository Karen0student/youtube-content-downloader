# youtube-content-downloader
downloading audio or video from youtube

this code opens Chromium with specified playlist from CLI or from file (HARDCODED PART, please read below), then from playlist it scraps url's of video, then it downloads or audio or video entered from CLI
Easy, right? 


ATTENTION HARDCODED PART!
if you want to enter a file with playlists, in main directory create 'youtube_link.txt' and fill it with playlists with number of video\audio you want to download
